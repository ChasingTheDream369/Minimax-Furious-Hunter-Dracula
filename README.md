# FURY OF DRACULA

An AI based Heuristic game based on graph algorithms, which is played by predicting the next move of hunter by dracula based on the previous set of hunter's visible moves. We use basic Dijkstra's and breadth first search for the purpose of this project with a slight variation of minimax algorithm to predict the next move.
